# Crash Mind Over Mutant Texture Pack
This is a texture pack created for the PlayStation 2 version of the game. Most of these textures were taken from the Xbox 360 version of the game. Others were upscaled or modified.

Go into "textures" folder, if it doesn't exist create a folder with the game serial you're going to use (e.g. "SLES-XXXXX"), inside this folder create a folder named "replacements", and extract the texture pack inside. Your address should look something like this: "PCSX2\textures\SLES-XXXXX\replacements". To activate the texture pack, go to "Graphics" settings, "Texture Replacement" tab and activate "Load Textures", "Asynchronous Texture Loading" and "Prechache Textures".
## Recommended way to play
On top of using the texture pack, it is recomended to do the following changes in the PCSX2 config settings to get the best experience:
-   If you use a widescreen, activate "Enable Widescreen Patches" in the Graphics settings.
-   In the game specific settings, go to Patches and activate the following patches: 50/60 FPS and Progressive Scan; then also activate the 180% EE Overclock in Emulation settings for the game.
